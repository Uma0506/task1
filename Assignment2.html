      <h2> <em>Ingredients: </em></h2>
        <ol type="i">
            <li>2 1/2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>2 1/2 teaspoons baking powder</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>1 cup (2 sticks) unsalted butter, softened</li>
            <li>2 cups granulated sugar</li>
            <li>4 large eggs</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
            <li>1 1/4 cups whole milk</li>
        </ol>
      <h2> <em>Instructions: </em></h2>
      <ol >
        <li>Preheat the Oven:</li>
          <p>Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). Grease and flour two 9-inch round cake pans.</p>
        <li>Combine Dry Ingredients:</li>
          <p>In a medium bowl, whisk together the flour, baking powder, and salt. Set aside.</p>
        <li>Cream Butter and Sugar:</li>
          <p>In a large mixing bowl, cream together the softened butter and sugar until light and fluffy. This can take about 3-5 minutes with an electric mixer.</p>
        <li>Add Eggs:</li>
          <p>Add the eggs one at a time, beating well after each addition.</p>
        <li>Add Vanilla:</li>
          <p>Mix in the vanilla extract.</p>
        <li>Alternate Dry Ingredients and Milk:</li>
          <p>Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients, mixing just until combined. Alternate with adding the milk in small increments, beginning and ending with the dry ingredients. Mix until just combined; do not overmix.</p>
        <li>Pour Batter into Pans:</li>
          <p>Divide the batter evenly between the prepared cake pans.</p>
        <li>Bake:</li>
          <p>Bake in the preheated oven for 25-30 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean.</p>
        <li>Cool:</li>
          <p>Allow the cakes to cool in the pans for 10 minutes, then transfer them to a wire rack to cool completely.</p>
        <li>Frosting (Optional):</li>
           <p>Once the cakes are completely cooled, you can frost them with your favorite frosting.</p>
